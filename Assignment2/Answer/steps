First I downloaded the data and stored it in a file
Then created a script that takes input from data file and outputs to a csv file
Tried to decipher the structure of data in Firefox and used appropriate jq commands to read inputs. 
Structure :
<state>: {
    delta7: {},
    districts: {
        <district> : {
            delta7: ..., 
            meta: ...
            total: {}
        }
        ...
    }
    meta: {},
    total: {}
}
...

Iterated over all states. And then looked at each district. 
For each district kept updating the max counts of recovered cases and the corresponding districts.

Checked for district =‘’Unknown “ and cases <5000 after reading the district and state datas.
